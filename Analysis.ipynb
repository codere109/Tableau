    "In my citibike presentation I've found that most of the data to be able to create a good visual story is limited to only a few columns. However what I was able to create was based off the birth year and I came across an interesting find. More bookings came from people born in the years of 1970-1990. Which I thought was kinda cool, because basically early 30s and early 50s are the most prominent bookers of citibike."
